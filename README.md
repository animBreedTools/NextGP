# NextGP: Next generation genomic prediction tools

- NextGP project aims at providing necessary analysis tools to quantitative/statistical geneticists for genomic predictions.
- As the name suggests, NextGP will focus on next generation of methods, though some traditional genomic preedictions methods as well as conventional mixed model type of analysis will be a part of the package for completeness.
- NextGP has two main focus:
   - Models for multi-breed analysis
   - Gene regulatory network estimation
-  NextGP will rely on a set of packages, which could be easily avoided. For example, some features in StatsModels package will be used, such as @formula macro and its subroutines to create fixed effect design matrices. The reasons to do so will be explained later.
