# NextGP: Next generation genomic prediction tools

- NextGP project aims at providing necessary analysis tools to quantitative/statistical geneticists for genomic predictions.
- As the name suggests, NextGP will focus on next generation of methods, though some traditional genomic preedictions methods as well as conventional mixed model type of analysis will be a part of the package for completeness.
- NextGP has two main focus:
   - Models for multi-breed analysis
   - Gene regulatory network estimation
-  NextGP will rely on a set of Julia packages, some of which could be easily avoided, or will be avoided in the later releases.
