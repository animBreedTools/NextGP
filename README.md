# NextGP: Next generation genomic prediction tools

- NextGP project aims at providing necessary analysis tools to quantitative/statistical geneticists for genomic predictions.
- As the name suggests, NextGP will focus on next generation of methods, though some traditional genomic prediction methods as well as conventional mixed model type of analysis will be a part of the package for completeness.
- I will implement Bayesian approach in parameter estimations. In most cases, a Gibbs sampling procedure will be used.
- NextGP has two main focus:
   - Models for multi-breed (population,line etc..) analysis
   - Gene regulatory network estimation
-  NextGP will rely on a set of Julia packages, some of which could be easily avoided, or will be avoided in the later releases.
