# About

* NextGP relies on several other Julia packages, which could be easily avoided and may be removed in the later releases.
* Currently one core dependency is the [StatsModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsModels.jl/latest/) package, for model expreession, and fixed effects design matrices generation.
* I suggest you first have a look at least [StatsModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsModels.jl/latest/formula/#The-@formula-language)  and  [StatsModels.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsModels.jl/latest/contrasts/#Modeling-categorical-data)
